English Translation of the given Text



In the deep shadows where whispers dwell
Rests the tongue of the enchantment of the Serpent,
Written in the heart of the night,
Words that twist the fate of the soul.
(Inscribed under the blood moon / Inscribed under the blood)
Secrets of the darkness attributed through time,
A pact with the chaos sown in writings of fire,
The truth is revealed.
Eternal flame in verse, more black,
Curses unite the universe;
Through these lines, the abyss speaks,
Unleashing fears in the courageous and meek.
Here lies the path to the unknown power,
A dark journey for the audacious;
But heed the price of this wicked art,
So that your virtuous soul does not part.
